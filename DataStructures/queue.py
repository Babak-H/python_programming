# Queue

'''
queue is a data structure similar to stack.
Queues, like the name suggests, follow the First-in-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 
As if waiting in a queue for the movie tickets, the first one to stand in line is the first one to buy a ticket and enjoy the movie.
To implement a queue, therefore, we need two simple operations:

enqueue - adds an element to the end of the queue
dequeue - removes the element at the beginning of the queue
